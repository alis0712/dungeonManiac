### A simple 2D Turn-based RPG made in combination with C++ and SDL2 as part of a summer course, which touched on the following C++ and SDL2 concepts: 

### 1) variables and math

### 2) input and output
  
### 3)  if statement, while and for loops
  
### 4) arrays, 1d and 2d
  
### 5) classes, inheritance and polymorphism

### 6) pointers and dynamic memory
  
### 7) rendering and animation
  
### 8) basic 2d game logic

### 9) Vectors as a container (but not used in the final build of the game and was taught as supplementary topic)

### Several screenshots of the game are shown below:
